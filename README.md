Project goal is to explore and demonstrate the feasibility of a software approach to remove or reduce the projector shutter shadow image from each frame of digital video recorded  when film is projected on a screen, and a camcorder or digital camera is used to record the images. The problem arises due to a mismatch between film projection rates and digital video rates in a digital camcorder or camera. The process involves identifying the position of the shutter image on a video frame, and reducing or removing the shutter shadow using a projector specific luminance profile of the shutter image. The MsWord document is the culmination of the exploration of the concept; it is detailed and huge; it explores the shutter image characteristics and its relationship to the video recording process, and presents a solution to removing the shutter image. The work is dependent on a variety of software tools with scripts to develop and explore the conversion process, including ImageJ/FIJI, MS Excel, R, and VirtualDub.  The main scripts to reduce or remove shutter shadows are written in python/jython for use with ImageJ or FIJI. They work, they are not pretty, and are definitely not the most efficient.
